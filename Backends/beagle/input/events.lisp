$Id: events.lisp,v 1.4 2005-05-19 22:25:34 drose Exp $

All these are copied pretty much from CLX/port.lisp

Changes made for Cocoa, obviously...

Events in Cocoa
---------------
In X, events are requested... in cocoa, the RUN LOOP passes them out to:

The NSApplication (send-event) + NSResponder methods
The NSWindow (send-event) + NSResponder methods
The NSView (NSResponder methods)

Each thread has a run-loop created for it, but only the run-loop in the application
main thread is run automatically.

CLIM appears to get all the events we want delivered "properly" to the NSView and NSWindow
subclasses. Some CLIM events come from NSWindow notifications rather than events, but we
map them all to CLIM events anyhow.

Suspect some of the coordinates we pass back to CLIM from here may be *wrong*.

;; peek-event from CLX/port.lisp?

;;; Given a NATIVE event, generate an appropriate corresponding CLIM event.
;;; There are a couple of X-specific events handled here which we don't have
;;; in cocoa (grab events and window hints), hopefully that won't matter to
;;; us (apart from the menus use grabbing I think)

;; From CLX/port.lisp
  
;; NOTE: Although it might be tempting to compress (consolidate)
;; events here, this is the wrong place. In our current architecture
;; the process calling this function (the port's event handler
;; process) just reads the events from the X server, and does it
;; with almost no lack behind the reality. While the application
;; frame's event top level loop does the actual processing of events
;; and thus may produce lack. So the events have to be compressed in
;; the frame's event queue.
;;
;; So event compression is implemented in EVENT-QUEUE-APPEND.
;;
;; This changes for possible _real_ immediate repainting sheets,
;; here a possible solution for the port's event handler loop can be
;; to read all available events off into a temponary queue (and
;; event compression for immediate events is done there) and then
;; dispatch all events from there as usual.

;;; the event. The timestamp must have at least as many bits of precision as a fixnum
;;;
;;; :sheet
;;; The sheet associated with the event
;;;
;;; :modifier-state
;;; An integer value that encodes the state of all the modifier keys on the keyboard.

;;;

;; This looks rather inefficient; ::FIXME:: make these user-configurable.
;; Can we make use of the other modifier states set by cocoa? Some of
