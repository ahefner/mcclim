(FIXED) 1. [flipping ink is implemented now, but see 11.]
    In the address book example example, the input cursor when typing
    and erasing characters is not getting removed properly, leaving a
    trace.

(FIXED) 2. [see clim-fix.lisp]
    Also, the presentation highlighting rectangle leaves traces if
    antialiasing is enabled.

(FIXED) 3.
    The text cursor does not show the correct horizontal position in climacs.

(FIXED) 4.
    Menus appear but do not really work.  Worth fixing, even though we
    would rather want native menus in the long term.

(FIXED) 5a. [but see 8.]
    Colored buttons (clim-fig) are missing.

5b.
    the slider needs tick marks

(FIXED) 5c.
    Inheriting from the standard gadget panes is bogus anyway, we should
    build them from scratch.

(FIXED) 5d.
    Default gadget values aren't being used.

6.
    Should work on Windows but does not.  Using the installer from
    gimp-win.sf.net I see an address book window, but there are cairo
    font warnings in the background and font metrik functions return
    totally bogus values sometimes.
    Although the hordes of sbcl/win32 hackers might contribute a native
    Windows backend sooner or later, it would be nice to get Gtkairo
    working on Windows, too.

7.
    (some?) drawing operations are rather slow.  (Remote X to an ancient
    server spends insane amounts of real (!) time doing XGetImage
    requests.  But even locally, where that isn't reproducable, it's not
    really snappy.  Just try scrolling in beirc.)

8.
    The frontend specifies background colors (*3d-normal-color*) where
    the gtk theme should take precedence.

(FIXED) 9.
    Sometimes repaint seems to draw again without clearing the window
    first.  For example, the header in demodemo gets darker with every
    repaint, until the originally antialiased text looks really crappy.
    (Now that mouse movement doesn't trigger repaints anymore this is
    harder to reproduce, but sometimes it can still be triggered.)

10.
    Somewhere global mouse coordinates aren't turned into local
    coordinates correctly.  (Watch the Drag&Drop test not work unless
    the window is in the upper left corner of the screen.)

(FIXED) 11.
    The new flipping ink implementation is buggy, it produces garbage
    output in some cases.

12.
    In the address book, there are often wide grey borders instead of
    the narrow black ones.

13.
    McCLIM seems to think that things like button panes have a maximum
    size equal to their preferred size.  I don't agree and return the
    default gtk size as space-requirement :width and :height without
    giving a maximum or minimum size at all.  Naturally, the existing
    demos look a little, erm, different with that.

14.
    Climacs doesn't draw itself until the window is resized.

(FIXED) 15.
    The text cursor does not show the correct vertical position in climacs.

(FIXED?) 16.
    Scroll panes are now native widgets, but don't really behave.  The
    scroll test works a little, many other examples don't.  See comment
    in update-scrollbar-adjustment.

17.
    There's a commented-out method on TRANSFORM-REGION for DESIGN in
    design.lisp.  See comment there.  clim-fix tried to reinstate it,
    but that doesn't work for gsharp when drawing ellipses.  Find out
    what this is all about.

18.
    Flipping ink optimization: As suggested by Gilbert, make the temporary
    pixmap just large enough for the clipping region and the currently
    visible part of a (scrolled) sheet.  Right now we're copying the
    entire window around, which seems excessive.
