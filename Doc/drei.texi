@node Drei Concepts
@section Drei Concepts

The reason for many of Drei's design decisions, and the complexity of
some of the code, is due to the flexibility that Drei is meant to
expose. Drei has to work as, at least, an input-editor, a text editor
gadget and a simple pane. These three different uses have widely
different semantics for reading input and performing redisplay - from
passively being fed gestures in the input editor, to having to event
handling and redisplay timing manually in the gadget
version. Furthermore, Drei is extensible software, so we wished to make
the differences between these three modus operandorum transparent to the
extender (as much as possible at least, unfortunately the Law of Leaky
Abstractions prevents us from reaching perfection). These two demands
require the core Drei protocols, especially those pertaining to
redisplay, gesture handling and accepting input from the user, to be
customizable by the different specialized Drei classes.

We call a specific instance of the Drei editor substrate a @i{Drei
instance}. A @i{Drei variant} is a specific subclass of @class{drei}
that implements a specific kind of editor, such as an input-editor or a
gadget. A given Drei instance has a single buffer associated with it,
but this buffer need not be unique to the Drei instance, and may be
changed at any time. The Drei instance has two marks into the buffer,
called the @i{top} and @i{bottom} mark. These marks delimit the visible
region of the buffer - for some Drei variants, this is always the entire
buffer, while others may only have a smaller visible region. Note that
not all of the visible region necessarily is on display on the screen
(parts, or all, of it may be hidden due to scrolling, for example), but
nothing outside the visible region is on display, though remember that
the same buffer may be used in several Drei instances, and that each of
these instances may have their own idea about what the visible region
is. The Drei instance also maintains marks for the current @i{point} and
@i{mark}. This means that different Drei instances sharing the same
buffer may have different points and marks. Every Drei instance also has
a @i{kill ring} object which contains object sequences that have been
killed from the buffer, and can be yanked back in at the users
behest. These are generally not shared.

Every Drei instance is associated with an editor pane - this must be a
CLIM stream pane that is used for redisplay (@pxref{Redisplay
Protocol}). This is not necessarily the same object as the Drei instance
itself, but it can be.

For each Drei instance, Drei attempts to simulate an application
top-level loop with something called a @i{pseudo command loop}, and
binds a number of special variables appropriately. This is to make
command writing more convenient and similar across all Drei variants,
but it also means that any program that uses one of the low-level Drei
variants that do not to this, such as @class{drei-pane}, need to bind
these special variables themselves, or Drei commands are likely to
malfunction.

Drei commands are meant to work by using the values of a number of
special variables bound by Drei during its pseudo command loop.  Here is
a list of them:

Somewhat counter-intuitively, the Drei instance. Not necessarily the
same as the editor pane.

@node Buffer Protocol
@subsection Buffer Protocol

The Drei buffer is what holds textual and other objects to be
edited and displayed.  Conceptually, the buffer is a potentially
large sequence of objects, most of which are expected to be
characters (the full Unicode character set is supported).  However,
Drei buffers can contain any Common Lisp objects, as long as the
syntax module knows how to render them.

The Drei  buffer implementation differs from that of a vector,
because it allows for very efficient editing operations, such as
inserting and removing objects at arbitrary offsets.

In addition, the Drei buffer protocols defines that concept of a
mark.

@node Implementation Hints
@subsubsection Implementation Hints

The buffer is implemented as lines organized in a 2-3-tree.  The
leaves of the tree contain the lines, and the internal nodes contain
additional information of the left subtree (if it is a 2-node) or the
left and the middle subtree (if it is a 3-node).  Two pieces of
information are stored: The number of lines in up to and including
the subtree and the total number of objects up to an including the
subtree.  This organization allows us to determine, the line number
and object position of any mark in O(log N) where N is the number of
lines.

A line is an instance of the `buffer-line' class.  A line can either
be open or closed.  A closed line is represented as a sequence.  The
exact type of the sequence depends on the objects contained in the
line.  If the line contains only characters of type base-char, then
the sequence is of type base-string.  If the line contains only
characters, but not of type base-char, the sequence is a string.
Otherwise it is a vector of arbitrary objects.  This way, closed
lines containing characters with code points below 256 have a compact
representation with 8 bits per character while still allowing for
arbitrary objects when necessary.  An open line is represented as a
cursorchain of objects.

Marks in a closed line are represented as an integer offset into the
sequence.  Marks in an open line are represented as flexicursors.

When a line is opened, it is converted to a cursorchain.  When a line
is closed, it is examined to determine whether it contains
non-character objects, in which case it is converted to a vector of
objects.  If contains only characters, but it contains characters
with code points above what can be represented in a base-char, it is
converted to a string.  If it contains only base-chars, it is
converted to a base-string.

A mark contains two slots: a flexicursor that determines which line it
is on, and either an integer (if the line is closed) that determines
the offset within the line or another flexicursor (if the line is
open).  For each line, open or closed, a list of weak references to
marks into that line is kept.

Lines are closed according to a LRU scheme.  Whenever objects are
inserted to or deleted from a line, it becomes the most recently used
line.  We keep a fixed number of open lines so that when a line is
opened and the threshold is reached, the least recently used line is
closed.

@node Buffer Modification Protocol
@subsection Buffer Modification Protocol

The buffer maintains two marks, the low mark and the high mark:

@include fun-drei-buffer-low-mark.texi

@include fun-drei-buffer-high-mark.texi

The low mark is a left-sticky mark and high mark is a right-sticky
mark.  Whenever a modification is made to the buffer, the offset of
the low mark is set to the minimum of its current value and the
position of the modification.  Similarly, whenever a modification is
made to the buffer, the offset of the high mark is set to the maximum
of its current value and the position of the modification.

The redisplay module may use these values to determine what part of
the screen needs to be updated.  These values can also be used to
update information about syntax highlighting and other cached
information.

In addition to these marks, the buffer maintains a modification flag
that determines.  Whether the buffer has been modified since the last
call to clear-modify.

@include fun-drei-buffer-modified-p.texi

@include fun-drei-buffer-clear-modify.texi

This function is used by the redisplay module after all of the panes
on display have been redisplayed properly.  A call to this function
concludes the interaction loop and Drei is again ready to read and
execute commands.

@node DREI-BASE Package
@subsection DREI-BASE Package

The buffer protocol has been designed to be reasonably efficient with a
variety of different implementation strategies (single gap buffer or
sequence of independent lines).  It contains (and should only contain)
the absolute minimum of functionality that can be implemented
efficiently independently of strategy.  However, this minimum of
functionality is not always convenient.

The purpose of the @package{DREI-BASE} package is to implement
additional functionality on top of the buffer protocol, in a way that
does not depend on how the buffer protocol was implemented.  Thus, the
@package{DREI-BASE} package should remain intact across different
implementation strategies of the buffer protocol.

Achieving portability of the @package{DREI-BASE} package is not terribly
hard as long as only buffer protocol functions are used.  What is
slightly harder is to be sure to maximize efficiency across several
implementation strategies.  The next section discusses such
considerations and gives guidelines to implementers of additional
functionality.

Implementers of the buffer protocol may use the contents of the next
section to make sure they respect the efficiency considerations that are
expected by the @package{DREI-BASE} package.

@menu
* Efficiency Considerations::   
@end menu

@node Efficiency Considerations
@subsubsection Efficiency considerations

In this section, we give a list of rules that implementors of
additional functionality should follow in order to make sure that such
functionality remains efficient (in addition to being portable) across
a variety of implementation strategies of the buffer protocol.

@quotation Rule
Comparing the position of two marks is efficient, i.e. at most O(log n)
where n is the number of marks in the buffer (which is expected to be
very small compared to the number of objects) in all implementations.
This is true for all types of comparisons.
@end quotation

It is expected that marks are managed very efficiently.  Some balanced
tree management might be necessary, which will make operations have
logarithmic complexity, but only in the number of marks that are
actually used.

@quotation Rule
While computing and setting the offset of a mark is fairly efficient,
it is not guaranteed to be O(1) even though it might be in an
implementation using a single gap buffer.  It might have a complexity
of O(log n) where n is the number of lines in the buffer.  This is
true for using incf on the offset of a mark as well, as incf expands
to a setf of the offset.

Do not hesitate computing or setting the offset of a mark, but avoid
doing it in a tight loop over many objects of the buffer.
@end quotation

@quotation Rule
Determining whether a mark is at the beginning or at the end of the
buffer is efficient, i.e. O(1), in all implementations.
@end quotation

@quotation Rule
Determining whether a mark is at the beginning or at the end of a line
is efficient, i.e. O(1), in all implementations.
@end quotation

@quotation Rule
Going to the beginning or to the end of a line might have linear-time
complexity in the number of characters of the line, though it is
constant-time complexity if the implementation is line oriented.

It is sometimes inevitable to use this functionality, and since lines
are expected to be short, it should not be avoided at all cost,
especially since it might be very efficient in some implementations.
We do recommend, however to avoid it in tight loops.

Always use this functionality rather than manually incrementing the
offset of a mark in a loop until a Newline character has been found,
especially since each iteration might take logarithmic time then.
@end quotation

@quotation Rule
Computing the size of the buffer is always efficient, i.e., O(1).
@end quotation

@quotation Rule
Computing the number of lines of the buffer is always efficient, i.e.,
O(1).
@end quotation

Implementations of the buffer protocol could always track the number
of insertions and deletions of objects, so there is no reason why this
operation should be inefficient.

@quotation Rule
Computing the line number of a mark or of an offset can be very
costly, i.e. O(n) where n is size of the buffer.
@end quotation

This operation is part of the buffer protocol because some
implementations may implement it fairly efficiently, say O(log n)
where n is the number of lines in the buffer.

@node Syntax Protocol
@subsection Syntax Protocol

A buffer always has a syntax module associated with it.  The syntax
module usually consists of an incremental parser that analyzes the
contents of the buffer and creates some kind of parse tree or other
representation of the contents in order that it can be exploited by the
redisplay module and by user commands.

* Incremental Parsing Framework::  
* Lexical Analysis::            
* Earley Parser::               
* Specifying A Grammar::        
@end menu

@node General Syntax Protocol
@subsubsection General Syntax Protocol

@include class-drei-syntax-syntax.texi

The redisplay module exploits the syntax module for several things:

@itemize @bullet
@item highlighting of various syntactic entities of the buffer
@item highlighting of matching parenthesis,
@item turning syntactic entities into clickable presentations,
@item marking lines with inconsistent indentation,
@item etc.
@end itemize

User commands can use the syntax module for:

@itemize @bullet
@item moving point by units that are specific to a particular buffer
syntax, such as expressions, statements, or paragraphs,
@item transposing syntactic units,
@item sending the text of a syntactic unit to a language processor,
@item indenting lines according to the syntax,
@item etc.
@end itemize

The view that the syntax module has of the buffer is updated only when
needed, and then only for the parts of the buffer that are needed.
Most syntax modules (such as for programming languages) need to
compute their representations from the beginning of the buffer up to a
particular point beyond which the structure of the buffer does not
need to be known.

There are three situations where updating might be needed:

@itemize @bullet
@item once, before any panes are displayed to inform the syntax module
that some part of the buffer has been altered,
@item once for each pane on display, before redisplay is about to show
the contents of part of the buffer in a pane to inform the syntax
module that its syntax must be valid in the particular region on
display,
@item as a result of a command that exploits the syntactic entities of
the buffer contents.
@end itemize

The first case is handled by the redisplay invoking the following
generic function:

@include fun-drei-syntax-update-syntax.texi

The second case is handled by the following generic function:

@include fun-drei-syntax-update-syntax-for-display.texi

The third case is handled by the syntax module itself when needed in
order to correctly compute the effects of a command.

It is important to realize that the syntax module is not directly
involved in displaying buffer contents in a pane.  In fact, the syntax
module should work even if there is no graphic user interface
present, and it should be exploitable by several, potentially totally
different, display units.

@node Incremental Parsing Framework
@subsubsection Incremental Parsing Framework

@include class-drei-syntax-parse-tree.texi

We use the term parse tree in a wider sense than what is common in the
parsing literature, in that a lexeme is a (trivial) parse tree.  The
parser does not distinguish between lexemes and other parse trees, and
a grammar rule can produce a lexeme if that should be desired.

@include fun-drei-syntax-start-offset.texi

@include fun-drei-syntax-end-offset.texi

The length of a parse-tree is thus the difference of its end offset
and its start offset.

The start offset and the end offset may be NIL which is typically the
case when a parse tree is derived from the empty sequence of lexemes.

@node Lexical Analysis
@subsubsection Lexical analysis

@include class-drei-syntax-lexer.texi

@include class-drei-syntax-incremental-lexer.texi

In the sequence of lexemes maintained by the incremental lexer, the
lexemes are indexed by a position starting from zero.

@node Earley Parser
@subsubsection Earley Parser

Drei contains an incremental parser that uses the Earley
algorithm.  This algorithm accepts the full set of context-free
grammars, allowing greater freedom for the developer to define natural
grammars without having to think about restrictions such as LL(k) or
LALR(k).

Beware, though, that the Earley algorithm can be quite inefficient if
the grammar is sufficiently complicated, in particular if the grammar
is ambiguous.

@node Specifying A Grammar
@subsubsection Specifying A Grammar

An incremental parser is created from a grammar.

@include macro-drei-syntax-grammar.texi

@deftp {Rule} {} symbol -> (&rest arguments) &optional body

Each rule is a list of this form.
@end deftp

Here @var{symbol} is the target symbol of the rule, and should be the
name of a CLOS class.

@deftp {Rule argument} {} (var type test)

The most general form of a rule argument.
@end deftp

@noindent

Here @var{var} is the name of a lexical variable.  The scope of the
variable contains the test, all the following arguments and the body
of the rule.  The @var{type} is a Common Lisp type specification.  The
rule applies only of the @var{type} of the object contain in var is of
that type.  The @var{test} contains arbitrary Common Lisp code for
additional checks as to the applicability of the rule.

@deftp {Rule argument} {} (var type)

Abbreviated form of a rule argument.
@end deftp

@noindent
Here, @var{type} must be a symbol typically the name of a CLOS class.
This form is an abbreviation for @code{(@var{var} @var{type} t)}.

@deftp {Rule argument} {} (var test)

Abbreviated form of a rule argument.
@end deftp

@noindent
Here, @var{test} must not be a symbol.  This form is an abbreviation
of @code{(@var{var} @var{var} @var{test})}, i.e., the name of the
variable is also the name of a type, typically a CLOS class.

@deftp {Rule argument} {} var

Abbreviated form of a rule argument.
@end deftp

@noindent
This form is an abbreviation of @code{(@var{var} @var{var} t)}.

The @var{body} of a rule, if present, contains an expression that should
have an instance (not necessarily direct) of the class named by the
symbol (the left-hand-side) of the rule.  It is important that this
restriction be respected, since the Earley algorithm will not work
otherwise.

If the @var{body} is absent, it is the same as if a body of the form
@code{(make-instance '@var{symbol})} had been given.

The body can also be a sequence of forms, the first one of which must be
a symbol.  These forms typically contain initargs, and will be passed as
additional arguments to @code{(make-instance '@var{symbol})}.

@node Unit Protocol
@subsection Unit Protocol
@cindex Drei unit protocol
@cindex Drei motion protocol
@cindex Drei editing protocol

Many of the actions performed by an editor is described in terms of the
syntactically unit(s) they affect. The syntax module is responsible for
actually dividing the buffer into syntactical units, but the @i{unit
protocol} is the basic interface for acting on these units. A @i{unit}
is some single syntactical construct - for example a word, a sentence,
an expression or a definition. The unit protocol defines a number of
generic functions for the various unit types that permit a uniform
interface to moving a mark a given number of units, deleting a unit,
killing a unit, transposing two units and so forth. A number of macros
are also provided for automatically generating all these functions,
given the definition of two simple movement functions. All generic
functions of the unit protocol dispatch on a syntax, so that every
syntax can implement its own idea of what exactly, for example, an
``expression'' is. Defaults are provided for some units - if nothing
else has been specified by the syntax, a word is considered any sequence
of alphanumeric characters delimited by non-alphanumeric characters.
@cindex unit

The type of unit that a protocol function affects is represented
directly in the name of the function - this means that a new set of
functions must be generated for every new unit you want the protocol to
support. In most cases, the code for these functions is very repetitive
and similar across the unit types, which is why the motion protocol
offers a set of macros that can generate function definitions for
you. These generator macros define their generated functions in terms of
basic motion functions.

A basic motion function is a function named @cl{FORWARD-ONE-@var{unit}}
or @cl{backward-one-@var{unit}} of the signature @cl{(@var{mark}
@var{syntax})} that returns true if any motion happened or false if a
limit was reached.
@cindex basic motion function

There isn't really a single all-encompassing unit protocol, instead, it
is divided into two major parts - a motion protocol defining functions
for moving point in terms of units, and an editing protocol for changing
the buffer in terms of units. Both use a similar interface and a general
mechanism for specifying the action to take if the intended operation
cannot be carried out.

Note that @cl{forward-object} and @cl{backward-object}, by virtue of
their low-level status and placement in the buffer protocol (see
buffer.lisp) do not obey this protocol, in that they have no syntax
argument. Therefore, all @cl{@var{frob}-object} functions and commands
(@pxref{Editing Protocol}) lack this argument as well. There are no
@cl{forward-one-object} or @cl{backward-one-object} functions.

@node Motors And Limit Actions
@subsubsection Motors And Limit Actions

A limit action is a function usually named
@cl{@var{mumble}-limit-action} of the signature @cl{(@var{mark}
@var{original-offset} @var{remaining-units} @var{unit} @var{syntax})}
that is called whenever a general motion function cannot complete the
motion. @var{Mark} is the mark the object in motion;
@var{original-offset} is the original offset of the mark, before any
motion; @var{remaining-units} is the number of units left until the
motion would be complete; @var{unit} is a string naming the unit; and
@var{syntax} is the syntax instance passed to the motion function. There
is a number of predefined limit actions:
@cindex limit action

@include fun-drei-motion-revert-limit-action.texi

@include condition-drei-motion-motion-limit-error.texi

@include fun-drei-motion-error-limit-action.texi

A @i{diligent motor} is a combination of two motion functions that has
the same signature as a standard motion function (@pxref{Motion
Protocol}). The primary motion function is called the @i{motor} and the
secondary motion function is called the @i{fiddler}. When the diligent
motor is called, it will start by calling its motor - if the motor
cannot carry out its motion, the fiddler will be called, and if the
fiddler is capable of performing its motion, the motor will be called
again, and if this second motor call also fails, the fiddler will be
called yet again, etc. If at any time the call to the fiddler fails, the
limit action provided in the call to the diligent motor will be
activated. A typical diligent motor is the one used to implement a
@t{Backward Lisp Expression} command - it attempts to move backwards by
a single expression, and if that fails, it tries to move up a level in
the expression tree and tries again.

@node Motion Protocol
@subsubsection Motion Protocol

The concept of a @i{basic motion function} was introduced in @ref{Unit
Protocol}. A general motion function is a function named
@cl{forward-@var{unit}} or @cl{backward-@var{unit}} of the signature
@cl{(@var{mark} @var{syntax} &optional (@var{count} 1)
(@var{limit-action} #'ERROR-LIMIT-ACTION))} that returns true if it
could move forward or backward over the requested number of units,
@var{count}, which may be positive or negative; and calls the limit
action if it could not, or returns @cl{NIL} if the limit action is
@cl{NIL}.

@node Editing Protocol
@subsubsection Editing Protocol

An editing function is a function named
@cl{forward-@var{frob}-@var{unit}} or
@cl{backward-@var{frob}-@var{unit}}, or just @cl{@var{frob}-@var{unit}}
in the case where discering between forward and backward commands does
not make sense (an example is @cl{transpose-@var{unit}}).

A proper unit is a unit for which all the functions required by the
motion protocol has been implemented, this can be trivially done by
using the macro @cl{define-motion-commands} (@pxref{Generator Macros}).

@node Redisplay Protocol
@subsection Redisplay Protocol
@cindex Drei redisplay
@cindex text-editor redisplay

A buffer can be on display in several panes, possibly by being located
in several Drei instances. Thus, the buffer does not concern itself with
redisplay, but assumes that its host Drei instance will redisplay when
appropriate. There is no predictable definitive rule for when a Drei
will be redisplayed, but when it is, it will be done by calling the
following generic function.

@deffn {Generic Function} {display-drei} frame drei
@findex display-drei

@var{Drei} must be an object of type @class{drei} and @var{frame} must
be a CLIM frame containing the editor pane of @var{drei}. If you define
a new subclass of @var{drei}, you must define a method for this generic
function. In most cases, methods defined on this function will merely be
a trampoline to a function specific to the given Drei.
@end deffn

The redisplay engine supports syntax-specific customization of the
display in order to facilitate such functionality as syntax
highlighting. This is done through the following two generic functions,
both of which have sensible default methods defined by the Fundamental
syntax, so if your syntax is a subclass of @class{fundamental-syntax},
you do not need to define them.

@node Undo Protocol
@subsection Undo Protocol

Undo is the facility by which previous modifications to the buffer can
be undone, returning the buffer state to what it was prior to some
modification.

Undo is organized into a separate module.  This module conceptually
maintains a tree where the nodes represent application states and the
arcs represent transitions between these states.  The root of the tree
represents the initial state of the application.  The undo module also
maintains a current state.  During normal application operation, the
current state is a leaf of a fairly long branch of the tree.  Normal
application operations add new nodes to the end of this branch.  Moving
the current state up the tree corresponds to an undo operation and
moving it down some branch corresponds to some redo operation.

Arcs in the tree are ordered so that they always point FROM the current
state.  When the current state moves from one state to the other, the
arc it traversed is reversed.  The undo module does this by calling a
generic function that client code must supply a method for.

Application states have no explicit representation, only undo records
do.  The current state is a pointer to an undo record (meaning, the
current state is BELOW the transition represented by the record) or to
the undo tree itself if the current state is the initial state of the
application.

@subsubsection How The Buffer Handles Undo

@include class-drei-undo-mixin.texi

Undo is implemented as :before methods on, insert-buffer-object,
insert-buffer-sequence and delete-buffer-range specialized on
undo-mixin.

@include fun-drei-undo-accumulate.texi

@include fun-drei-performing-undo.texi

Three subclasses @cl{insert-record}, @cl{delete-record}, and
@cl{compound-record} of undo-record are used.  An insert record stores a
position and some sequence of objects to be inserted, a delete record
stores a position and the length of the sequence to be deleted, and a
compound record stores a list of other undo records.

The :before methods on @cl{insert-buffer-object} and
@cl{insert-buffer-sequence} push a record of type delete-record onto the
undo accumulator for the buffer, and the :before method on
@cl{delete-buffer-range} pushes a record of type @cl{insert-record} onto
the undo accumulator.

@include macro-drei-with-undo.texi

To avoid storing an undo record for each object that is inserted,
the with-undo macro may in some cases just increment the length of
the sequence in the last delete-record.

The method on @cl{flip-undo-record} specialized on @cl{insert-record}
binds @cl{performing-undo} for the buffer to @cl{T}, inserts the
sequence of objects in the buffer, and calls @cl{change-class} to
convert the @cl{insert-record} to a @cl{delete-record}, giving it a the
length of the stored sequence.

The method on @cl{flip-undo-record} specialized on @cl{delete-record}
binds @cl{performing-undo} for the buffer to @cl{T}, deletes the range
from the buffer, and calls @cl{change-class} to convert the
@cl{delete-record} to an @cl{insert-record}, giving it the sequence at
the stored offset in the buffer with the specified length.

The method on @cl{flip-undo-record} specialized on @cl{compound-record}
binds @cl{performing-undo} for the buffer to @cl{T}, recursively calls
@cl{flip-undo-record} on each element of the list of undo records, and
finally destructively reverses the list.

@node Kill Ring Protocol
@subsection Kill Ring Protocol

During the process of text editing it may become necessary for regions
of text to be manipulated non-sequentially.  The kill ring and its
surrounding protocol offers both a temporary location for data to be
stored, as well as methods for stored data to be accessed.

Conceptually, the kill ring is a stack of bounded depth, so that when
elements are pushed beyond that depth, the oldest element is removed.
All newly added data is attached to a single point at the ``start of
ring position'' or SORP.

This protocol provides two methods which govern how data is to be
attached to the SORP.  The first method moves the current SORP to a new
position, on to which a new object is attached.  The second conserves
the current position and replaces its contents with a sequence
constructed of new and pre-existing SORP objects.  This latter method is
refered to as a ``concatenating push''.

For data retrievial the kill ring class provides a ``yank point'' which
allows focus to be shifted from the SORP to other positions within the
kill ring.  The yank point is limited to two types of motition, one
being a rotation away from the SORP and the other being an immediate
return or ``reset'' to the start position. When the kill ring is
modified, for example by a push, the yank point will be reset to the
start position.

@node Kill Ring Implementation
@subsubsection Kill Ring Implementation

The kill ring structure is built mainly of two parts: the stack like
ring portion, which is a cursorchain, and the yank point, which is a
left-sticky-flexicursor.  To initialize a kill ring, the :max-size slot
initarg is simply used to set the max size.  The remaining slots
constisting of the cursorchain and the left-sticky-flexicursor are
instantized upon creation of the kill ring.

Stored onto the cursorchain are simple-vectors of objects, mainly
characters from a Drei buffer.  In order to facilitate this, the kill
ring implementation borrows heavily from the flexichain library of
functions. The following functions lie outside the kill ring and
flexichain protocols, but are pertinent to the kill ring implementation.

@node Defining Drei Commands
@section Defining Drei Commands

Drei commands are standard CLIM commands that are stored in standard
CLIM command tables. Drei uses a number of distinct command tables, some
of which are merely used to group commands by category, and some whose
contents may only be applicable under specific circumstances. When the
contents of a command table is applicable, that command table is said to
be active. Some syntaxes may define specific command tables that will
only be active for buffers using that syntax. Commands in such tables
are called syntax-specific commands.

@end menu

@node Drei Command Tables
@subsection Drei Command Tables

Here is a list of the command tables that are always active, along with
a note describing what they are used for:

@deftp {Command Table} comment-table
Commands for dealing with comments in, for example, source code. For
syntaxes that do not have the concept of a comment, many of the commands
of this table will not do anything.
@end deftp
@deftp {Command Table} deletion-table
Commands that destructively modify buffer contents.
@end deftp
@deftp {Command Table} editing-table
Commands that transform the buffer contents somehow (such as transposing
two words).
@end deftp
@deftp {Command Table} fill-table
Commands that fill (wrap) text.
@end deftp
@deftp {Command Table} case-table
Commands that modify the case of characters.
@end deftp
@deftp {Command Table} indent-table
Commands that indent text based on the current syntax.
@end deftp
@deftp {Command Table} marking-table
Commands that deal with managing the mark or nondestructively copying
buffer contents.
@end deftp
@deftp {Command Table} movement-table
Commands that move point.
@end deftp
@deftp {Command Table} search-table
Commands that can search the buffer.
@end deftp
@deftp {Command Table} info-table
Commands that display information about the state of the buffer.
@end deftp
@deftp {Command Table} self-insert-table
Commands that insert the gesture used to invoke them into the
buffer. You probably won't need to add commands to this table.
@end deftp
@deftp {Command Table} editor-table
A command table that inherits from the previously mentioned tables (plus
some more). This command table is the ``basic'' table for accessing Drei
commands, and is a good place to put your own user-defined commands if
they do not fit in another table.
@end deftp

There are also two conditionally-active command tables:

@deftp {Command Table} exclusive-gadget-table
This command table is only active in the gadget version of Drei.
@end deftp
@deftp {Command Table} exclusive-input-editor-table
This command table is only active when Drei is used as an input-editor.
@end deftp

When you define keybindings for your commands, you should put the
keybindings in the same command table as the command itself.

@node Numeric Argument In Drei
@subsection Numeric Argument In Drei
@cindex numeric argument

The numeric argument state is currently not directly accessible from
within commands. However, Drei uses ESA's numeric argument processing
code, Drei commands can thus be provided with numeric arguments in the
same way as ESA commands can. When using @cl{set-key} to setup
keybindings, provide the value of @cl{*numeric-argument-marker*} as an
argument to have the command processing code automatically insert the
value of the numeric argument whenever the keybinding is invoked. You
can also use @cl{*numeric-argument-p*} to have a boolean value, stating
whether or not a numeric argument has been provided by the user,
inserted. Note that you must write your commands to accept arguments
before you can do this (@pxref{Examples Of Defining Drei Commands}).

@node Examples Of Defining Drei Commands
@subsection Examples Of Defining Drei Commands
@cindex Drei command defining
@cindex defining Drei commands

A common text editing task is to repeat the word at point, but for some
reason, Drei does not come with a command to do this, so we need to
write our own. Fortunately, Drei is extensible software, and to that
end, a @package{DREI-USER} package is provided that is intended for user
customizations. We're going to create a standard CLIM command named
@cl{com-repeat-word} in the command table @cl{editing-table}. The
implementation consists of cloning the current point, move it a word
backward, and insert into the buffer the sequence delimited by point and
our moved mark. Our command takes no arguments.

@lisp
(define-command (com-repeat-word :name t
                                 :command-table editing-table)
    ()
  (let ((mark (clone-mark *current-point*)))
    (backward-word mark *current-syntax* 1)
    (insert-sequence mark (region-to-sequence mark *current-point*))))
@end lisp

For @cl{*current-point*} and @cl{*current-syntax*}, see @ref{Special
Variables}.

This command facilitates the single repeat of a word, but that's
it. This is not very useful - instead, we would like a command that
could repeat a word an arbitrary (user-supplied) number of times. The
primary way for a CLIM command to ask for user-supplied values is to use
command arguments. We define a new command that takes an integer
argument specifying the number of times to repeat the word at point.

@lisp
(define-command (com-repeat-word :name t
                                 :command-table editing-table)
    ((count 'integer :prompt "Number of repeats"))
  (let ((mark (clone-mark *current-point*)))
    (backward-word mark *current-syntax* 1)
    (let ((word (region-to-sequence mark *current-point*)))
      (dotimes (i count)
        (insert-sequence mark word)))))
@end lisp

Great - our command is now pretty full-featured. But with an editing
operation as common as this, we really want it to be quickly accessible
via some intuitive keystroke. We choose @kbd{M-C-r}. Also, it'd be nice
if, instead of interactively quering us for commands, the command would
just use the value of the numeric argument as the number of times to
repeat. There's no way to do this with a named command (ie. when you run
the command with @kbd{M-x}), but it's quite easy to do in a
keybinding. We use the ESA @cl{set-key} function:

@lisp
(set-key `(com-repeat-word ,*numeric-argument-marker*)
         'editing-table
         '((#\r :control :meta)))
@end lisp

Now, pressing @kbd{M-C-r} will result in the @cl{com-repeat-word}
command being run with the first argument substituted for the value of
the numeric argument. Since the numeric argument will be 1 if nothing
else has been specified by the user, we are guaranteed that the first
argument is always an integer, and we are guaranteed that the
@var{count} argument will have a sensible default, even if the user does
not explicitly provide a numeric argument.

@node Drei's Syntax Command Table Protocol
@subsection Drei's Syntax Command Table Protocol
@cindex syntax command table

In order to provide conditionally active command tables, Drei defines
the @class{syntax-command-table} class. While this class is meant to
facilitate the addition of commands to syntaxes when they are run in a
specific context (for example, a large editor application adding a Show
Macroexpansion command to Lisp syntax), their modus operandi is general
enough to be used for all conditional activity of command tables.
