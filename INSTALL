Install instructions for Franz Allegro Common Lisp
--------------------------------------------------

1. Start Lisp

2. Load the system definition file:

   (load "system")

3. Load the source code of the system:

   (load-system :clim :interpreted t)
   (load-system :clim-clx :interpreted t)
   (load-system :clim-examples :interpreted t)

4. Compile and load the system:

   (compile-system :clim)
   (compile-system :clim-clx)
   (compile-system :clim-examples)

5. Load the compiled system:

   (load-system :clim)
   (load-system :clim-clx)
   (load-system :clim-examples)

Running the demos
-----------------

1. Run the calculator demo

   (clim-demo::calculator)

   This demo is self-explanatory.
	
   when you get tired of it, hit ^C in the Lisp listener.

2. Run the menu demo

   (menutest::menutest)

   This demo is self-explanatory.
	
   when you get tired of it, hit ^C in the Lisp listener.

3. Run the slider demo

   (clim-demo::colorslider)

   You should see three sliders on the left and a color area on the right. 
   Use the three sliders to adjust RGB values to obtain a color.

   when you get tired of it, hit ^C in the Lisp listener.


Note:

   Before running any McCLIM application, it may be necessary for you
   to enable host based access to the X server. This can be
   accomplished by executing the following command at a shell prompt:

	xhost localhost
