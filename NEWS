* Changes in mcclim-0.9.5 relative to 0.9.4:
** specification compliance: various layout panes no longer quite as
   aggressive at eating the space requirements of their children.
** Drei now has better support for delimiter gestures.
** Installation: the systems clim-listener, scigraph, clim-examples,
   and clouseau can now be loaded without loading the system mcclim
   first.
** improvement: the CLX backend should no longer cause focus stealing
   when an application has text-editor panes.  This change comes with
   a rudimentary click-to-focus-keyboard widget policy.

* Changes in mcclim-0.9.4 relative to 0.9.3:
** cleanup: removed the obsolete system.lisp file.
** backend improvements: Gtkairo
*** Double buffering is now supported (fixes disappearing widgets on Windows).
*** X errors no longer terminate the lisp process.
*** Some bugfixes, including CMUCL support and better key event handling.
*** Native implementation of context menus, list panes, label panes, and
    option panes.
*** Draw text using Pango.  (Bug fix: Fixed-width font supported on Windows
    now.  Multiple lines of output in TEXT-SIZE supported now.
    TEXT-STYLE-FIXED-WIDTH-P works correctly now.)
** Improvement: Added new editor substrate ("Drei").

** specification compliance: PRESENTATION-TYPE-SPECIFIER-P presentaion
   function now implemented.

   now implemented.
** specification compliance: POINTER-INPUT-RECTANGLE* function now
   implemented.
** specification compliance: POINTER-INPUT-RECTANGLE function now
   implemented.
** Improvement: Added font listing support, see section "Fonts and Extended
   Text Styles" in the manual.
** Improvement: Added support for bezier splines (Robert Strandh).
   To be documented.
** better PRESENTATION-SUBTYPEP (more likely to give the right answer
   on some-of and all-of presentation types)
** Improvement: M-n/M-p gestures for navigating presentation histories.

* Changes in mcclim-0.9.3 "All Souls' Day" relative to 0.9.2:
** backend improvement: The Null backend now registers itself in the
   server search path
** improvement: with-output-as-gadget now sets the correct cursor
   position when incremental redisplay is active.
** specification compliance: INVOKE-WITH-NEW-OUTPUT-RECORD's argument
   list now is the same as the one in the Franz CLIM user guide.
** improvement: The text field cursor is now a solid block again.
** backend improvement: the PostScript backend now outputs correct EPS
** improvement: Graph nodes can now be dragged
** improvement: Possibilities when reading from
   COMPLETE-FROM-GENERATOR are now sorted alphabetically.
** new experimental backend: gtkairo (loads on SBCL, CMUCL and SCL):
   Uses GTK+ for gadgets and cairo for rendering graphics.
** Bug fix: incremental-redisplay does no longer leak memory
** improvement: incremental-redisplay is now a little faster
** Bug fix: Invisible text cursors no longer leave a dangling space
   behind the text output record
** improvement: commands whose names are shadowed in child command
   tables are now suggested in preference to their parents.
** Bug fix: (setf stream-cursor-position) and output record replay on
   encapsulating streams work now.

** specification compliance: MENU-CHOOSE now supports almost all
   features demanded in the CLIM 2.0 specification.
** improvement: new and improved ACCEPT presentation method for

** specification compliance: LOOKUP-KEYSTROKE-ITEM no longer accepts
   the :errorp argument.
** Bug fix: incremental redisplay no longer breaks on output records
   that had no children.
** Bug fix: arrow head sizes are now transformed along with the line thickness.
