 <b>CHAPTER 12. GRAPHICS </b><br>
<br>
 Coordinates are real numbers in implementation-defined units. Often these units equal the spa-<br>
 tial resolution of a viewport, so that a line of thickness 1 is equivalent to the thinnest visible line.<br>
 However, this equivalence is not required and should not be assumed by application programs.<br>
<br>
 A valid CLIM implementation can be quite restrictive in the size and resolution of its viewports.<br>
 For example, the spatial resolution might be only a few dozen points per inch, the maximum size<br>
 might be only a few hundred points on a side, and there could be as few as two displayable colors<br>
 (usually black and white). The fully transparent and fully opaque opacity levels must always be<br>
 supported, but a valid CLIM implementation might support only a few opacity levels in between<br>
 (or possibly even none). A valid CLIM implementation might implement color blending and<br>
 unsaturated colors by stippling, although it is preferred, when possible, for a viewport to display<br>
 a uniform color as a uniform color rather than as a perceptible stipple.<br>
<br>
 When CLIM records the output to a sheet, there are no such limitations since CLIM just re-<br>
 members the drawing operations that were performed, not the results of rendering.<br>
<br>
 CLIM provides some ways to ask what resolution limits are in effect
    for a medium. See <A HREF="./page77.html">Chapter 10</A><br>
 for their descriptions.<br>
<br>
 The application programmer uses the CLIM graphic drawing model as an interface to describe<br>
 the intended visual appearance. An implementation does its best to approximate that ideal<br>
 appearance in a viewport, within its limitations of spatial resolution, color resolution, number<br>
 of simultaneously displayable colors, and drawing speed. This will usually require tradeoffs,<br>
 for example between speed and accuracy, and each implementation must make these tradeoffs<br>
 according to its own hardware/software environment and user concerns. For example, if the<br>
 actual device supports a limited number of colors, the desired color may be approximated by<br>
 techniques such as dithering or stippling. If the actual device cannot draw curves exactly, they<br>
 may be approximated, with or without anti-aliasing. If the actual device has limited opacity<br>
 resolution, color blending may be approximate. A viewport might display colors that don't<br>
 appear in the drawing plane, both because of color and opacity approximation and because of<br>
 anti-aliasing at the edges of drawn shapes.<br>
<br>
 It is likely that different implementations will produce somewhat different visual appearance<br>
 when running the same application. If an application requires more detailed control, it must<br>
 resort to a lower-level interface, and will become less portable as a result. These lower-level<br>
 interfaces will be documented on a per-platform basis.<br>
<br>
 Drawing computations are always carried out "in color", even if the viewport is only capable of<br>
 displaying black and white. In other words, the CLIM drawing model is always the fully general<br>
 model, even if an implementation's color resolution is limited enough that full use of the model<br>
 is not possible. Of course an application that fundamentally depends on color will not work well<br>
 on a viewport that cannot display color. Other applications will degrade gracefully.<br>
<br>
 Whether the implementation uses raster graphics or some other display technique is invisible<br>
 at this interface. CLIM does not specify the existence of pixels nor the exact details of scan<br>
 conversion, which will vary from one drawing engine to the next.<br>
<br>
 Performance will also vary between implementations. This interface is defined in terms of simple<br>
 conceptual operations, however an actual implementation may use caching, specialized object<br>
 representations, and other optimizations to avoid materializing storage-intensive or computation-
