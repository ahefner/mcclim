 <br><b>12.4 Rendering Conventions for Geometric Shapes<br><br>
 </b>The intent of this section is to describe the conventions for how CLIM should render a shape on<br>
 a display device. These conventions and the accompanying examples are meant to describe a set<br>
 of goals that a CLIM implementation should try to meet. However, compliant CLIM implemen-<br>
 tations may deviate from these goals if necessary (for example, if the rendering performance on<br>
 a specific platform would be unacceptably slow if these goals were met exactly and implementors<br>
 feel that users would be better served by speed than by accuracy). Note that we discuss only<br>
 pixel-based display devices here, which are the most common, but by no means the only, sort of<br>
 display device that can be supported by CLIM.<br>
<br>
 When CLIM draws a geometric shape on some sort of display device, the idealized geometric<br>
 shape must somehow be rendered on the display device. The geometric shapes are made up of a<br>
 set of mathematical points, which have no size; the rendering of the shape is usually composed<br>
 of pixels, which are roughly square. These pixels exist in "device coordinates", which are gotten<br>
 by transforming the user-supplied coordinates by all of the user-supplied transformation, the<br>
 medium transformation, and the transformation that maps from the sheet to the display device.<br>
 (Note that if the last transformation is a pure translation that translates by an integer multiple<br>
 of device units, then it has no effect on the rendering other than placement of the figure drawn<br>
 on the display device.)<br>
<br>
 Roughly speaking, a pixel is affected by drawing a shape only when it is inside the shape (we will<br>
 define what we mean by "inside" in a moment). Since pixels are little squares and the abstract<br>
 points have no size, for most shapes there will be many pixels that lie only partially inside<br>
 the shape. Therefore, it is important to describe the conventions used by CLIM as to which<br>
 pixels should be affected when drawing a shape, so that the proper interface to the per-platform<br>
 rendering engine can be constructed. (It is worth noting that on devices that support color or<br>
 grayscale, the rendering engine may attempt to draw a pixel that is partially inside the shape<br>
 darker or lighter, depending on how much of it is inside the shape. This is called <b>anti-aliasing</b>.)<br>
 The conventions used by CLIM is the same as the conventions used by
    X11:<br>
<ul>
 <li>A pixel is a addressed by its upper-left corner.<br>
<br>
 <li>A pixel is considered to be <b>inside </b>a shape, and hence affected by the rendering of that<br>
 shape, if the center of the pixel is inside the shape. If the center of the pixel lies exactly<br>
 on the boundary of the shape, it is considered to be inside if the inside of the shape is<br>
 immediately to the right (increasing <i>x </i>direction on the display device) of the center point<br>
 of the pixel. If the center of the pixel lies exactly on a horizontal boundary, it is considered<br>
 to be inside if the inside of the shape is immediately below (increasing <i>y </i>direction on the<br>
 display device) the center point of the pixel.<br>
<br>
 <li>An unfilled shape is drawn by taking the filled shape consisting of those points that are<br>
 within 1/2 the line thickness from the outline curve (using a normal distance function, that<br>
 is, the length of the line drawn at right angles to the tangent to the outline curve at the<br>
 nearest point), and applying the second rule, above.
