    These are TODO's from the 0.9 release notes. The listed functions
    are unimplemented unless otherwise noted.

    General designs need more work, particularly the support of
    compositing.

    A compound output recording record structure based on R trees or
    another spatial data structure is needed.

    surrounding-output-with-border - :move-cursor

    Changing the sheet-transformation of a pane does not alter its
    native transformation, despite the fact that calls are made to
    invalidate-cached-transformations and
    note-sheet-transformation-changed.  Perhaps this code is
    responsible:  

    (defmethod invalidate-cached-transformations ((sheet mirrored-sheet-mixin))
      (with-slots (native-transformation device-transformation) sheet
	(setf ;; native-transformation nil XXX hm...
	      device-transformation nil))
      (loop for child in (sheet-children sheet)
	    do (invalidate-cached-transformations child)))

RS:20030805:101708
    The way the text-field pane handles keyboard input focus (by
    remembering who had it before and restoring it) does not work very
    well with respect to other X applications.  It would be better for
    each pane to decide when it wants the input focus. 

======================  Resolved issues ======================
RS:20030805:102038
    Output recording is broken for records that inherit from
    coord-seq-mixin.  Contrary to comments in the code, the coordinate
    sequence is not transformed before the output record is created.
    [resolved by moore and hefner in various ways]
