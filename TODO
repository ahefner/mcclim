    Changing the sheet-transformation of a pane does not alter its
    native transformation, despite the fact that calls are made to
    invalidate-cached-transformations and
    note-sheet-transformation-changed.  Perhaps this code is
    responsible:  

    (defmethod invalidate-cached-transformations ((sheet mirrored-sheet-mixin))
      (with-slots (native-transformation device-transformation) sheet
	(setf ;; native-transformation nil XXX hm...
	      device-transformation nil))
      (loop for child in (sheet-children sheet)
	    do (invalidate-cached-transformations child)))

    The way the text-field pane handles keyboard input focus (by
    remembering who had it before and restoring it) does not work very
    well with respect to other X applications.  It would be better for
    each pane to decide when it wants the input focus.

    Output recording is broken for records that inherit from
    coord-seq-mixin.  Contrary to comments in the code, the coordinate
    sequence is not transformed before the output record is created.
