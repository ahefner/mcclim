    These are TODO's from the 0.9 release notes. The listed functions
    are unimplemented unless otherwise noted.

    General designs need more work, particularly the support of
    compositing.

    A compound output recording record structure based on R trees or
    another spatial data structure is needed.

    make-design-from-output-record

    (setf* pointer-position)

    drag-output-record, dragging-output

    More spiffy presentation accept and present methods

    define-drag-and-drop-translator

    with-input-editor-typeout

    read-only extents in Goatee

    with-accept-help

    accepting-values needs a lot of work

    command-line-complete-input

    display-command-table-menu, menu-choose-command-from-table

    raise-frame, bury-frame, notify-user

    :accept-values panes

    frame-drag-and-drop-feedback, frame-drag-and-drop-highlighting 

    command-enable, display-command-menu

    restraining-pane

    Changing the sheet-transformation of a pane does not alter its
    native transformation, despite the fact that calls are made to
    invalidate-cached-transformations and
    note-sheet-transformation-changed.  Perhaps this code is
    responsible:  

    (defmethod invalidate-cached-transformations ((sheet mirrored-sheet-mixin))
      (with-slots (native-transformation device-transformation) sheet
	(setf ;; native-transformation nil XXX hm...
	      device-transformation nil))
      (loop for child in (sheet-children sheet)
	    do (invalidate-cached-transformations child)))

RS:20030805:101708
    The way the text-field pane handles keyboard input focus (by
    remembering who had it before and restoring it) does not work very
    well with respect to other X applications.  It would be better for
    each pane to decide when it wants the input focus.

    is defined and called, but there aren't real methods defined yet.]

    Output recording is broken for records that inherit from
    coord-seq-mixin.  Contrary to comments in the code, the coordinate
    sequence is not transformed before the output record is created.
    [resolved by moore and hefner in various ways]
