    Output recording is broken for records that inherit from
    coord-seq-mixin.  Contrary to comments in the code, the coordinate
    sequence is not transformed before the output record is created.

    The way the text-field pane handles keyboard input focus (by

    each pane to decide when it wants the input focus.
